# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## About Project :

The components added are dynamic in nature like in future if we get additional Alcohal class , the UI will render the mean meadian mode of additional class as well .

Due to inconsistency in given data , I had to use any type at one place where i dividing data bsed on Alcohal Class.

used code splitting to minimize the initial load time for JS script 

used Modular functions to avoid any repetition.
